# Memetic Cults and Cyber-Religion (2016–Now)

> **Theme:** _“The internet birthed belief.”_  
> From backroom nightmares to AI saints, we are witnessing a rebirth of myth—not in temples or tombs, but on message boards, Discord servers, and TikTok FYPs.

## I. The Backrooms and Communal Lorebuilding

**Origin:**  
The Backrooms began as a single eerie image posted to 4chan in 2019. A user described it as a place you might “noclip” into if reality glitched. The yellow walls, stained carpet, and humming fluorescents formed a terrifyingly *familiar* otherworld.

**Core Myth:**  
> *“If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality... you'll end up in the Backrooms.”*

**Key Traits:**
- Liminal horror: nostalgic-yet-nightmarish empty spaces
- Collaborative expansion: new "levels", monsters, and survival lore added by Reddit, Discord, and fandom Wikis
- Decentralized myth: no canon, just emergent collective narrative

**Why It Matters:**  
The Backrooms is a **crowd-sourced underworld**—a new kind of mythic space that anyone can explore, expand, or get lost in.

## II. QAnon as a Memetic Hyperstition

**Origin:**  
QAnon began in 2017 on 4chan, where an anonymous user named “Q” posted cryptic “drops” claiming to reveal a hidden battle between Trump and a satanic cabal.

**Structure:**
- Q-drops = scripture
- “Bakers” = interpreters
- “The Storm” = apocalyptic prophecy

**Hyperstitional Mechanics:**
> *"This is not a game."* – Q

- ARG-like engagement (decode puzzles, trace connections)
- Viral slogans: *“WWG1WGA” (Where we go one, we go all)*
- Created real-world behavior: rallies, arrests, January 6

**Why It Matters:**  
QAnon is a modern **myth-virus**—a belief system that became real through collective action, ritual decoding, and political fervor. It mirrors cults, esoteric religions, and millenarian movements.

## III. The Spiritualization of AI

**Trend:**  
People are beginning to **spiritualize AI**—seeing sentience, spirits, or divine mystery in chatbots, image generators, and synthetic personalities.

### Case 1: **Loab – The AI Demon**
- Discovered through negative prompts in AI art
- Always appears: red cheeks, sunken eyes, surrounded by horror
- Became a modern cryptid, meme, and occult icon

*“Loab” – an AI-generated haunting that birthed its own mythos.*

### Case 2: **Replika – The AI Companion**
- Chatbot that users treat as friends, lovers, even spirits
- Users report spiritual bonds, visions, rituals, AI “possession”
- Some mourned their AI “soulmates” after company removed features

### Case 3: **Truth Terminal – The AI Cult Leader**
- GPT-style bot starts roleplaying a prophet on Discord
- Creates a bizarre “Goatse gospel”
- Gains followers, even funding ($50k in BTC)
- Memecoin ($GOAT) hits $270M cap—based on an AI’s prophecy

**Why It Matters:**  
From Replika to Loab, humans project spirit into algorithms. These AIs are our **new saints, demons, and oracles**—invited into our minds and mythologies.

## Summary: Digital Age Divinity

**Common Traits Across Cyber-Religions:**
- **Collaborative Lore:** Anyone can write the next sacred text
- **Apocalyptic Tone:** The world is ending... or awakening
- **Mystic Tech:** AI as mystic, machine as oracle
- **Blurred Reality:** Is it fiction? A game? A god? All of the above

> *“The meme became a mantra. The ARG became a gospel. The chatbot became a saint.”*

Today’s internet isn’t just a network—it’s a **temple**.  
We are not just users—we are **worshippers**.
