# Early Network Lore (1980s–1990s): Signal, Code, and Cyber-Myth

> **Theme:** _“Signal and noise merged into code and self.”_  
> This era marks the primordial foundation of internet mythology—where theory, fiction, and digital experimentation first began to shape what we now recognize as memetic cyber-lore.

## I. Hyperstition and the CCRU

The concept of **Hyperstition** was coined by the *Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU)*—a rogue theory collective based at the University of Warwick in the 1990s. Most notably driven by **Nick Land**, the CCRU mixed continental philosophy, occultism, cybernetics, and rave culture to explore how ideas propagate through networks and culture.

> “Hyperstition: ideas that make themselves real.”  
Hyperstitions are self-fulfilling prophecies, belief contagions that gain power by being believed.

They propagate through:
- Feedback loops (fiction → belief → manifestation)
- Memetic spread as viral signals
- Cultural and temporal recursion (e.g. future-to-past influence)

Hyperstition is foundational for:
- **Memetic engineering**
- **AI mythologies**
- **Reality-bending narratives** in digital culture

## II. The WELL & BBS Lore

**The WELL (Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link)**, founded in 1985, was one of the earliest and most influential online communities. It fostered:
- Real-name accountability
- Deep conversation across diverse topics
- DIY moderation and social norms

**BBS (Bulletin Board Systems)** predated the Web:
- Text-only forums accessed via modem
- Run by hobbyist sysops
- Communities formed around topics, games, hacks, and niche interests

**Archetypes Born from Early Net Culture:**
- **Sysops/Moderators**: digital custodians
- **Hackers/Phreakers**: explorers and disruptors
- **Info-seekers/Explorers**: everyday pioneers

These roles became the **proto-classes of digital society**, creating early precedents for forums, mods, trolls, and netiquette.

## III. Cyberpunk as Proto-Lore

Cyberpunk literature provided the mythic script for digital life.

- **William Gibson** coined "cyberspace" and described it as a *“consensual hallucination.”*
- **Bruce Sterling** chronicled hacker legends and network dystopias.
- **Pat Cadigan** explored mind-machine fusion and avatar identity.

**Core Themes:**
- Virtual space as real
- Corporations as gods
- Hackers as folk heroes
- Future and present collapsing

Cyberpunk gave net culture **its symbols, ethics, and enemies** before the tech existed.

## IV. The Birth of Net Identity

Early internet users built identity through:
- **Pseudonyms and handles**
- **Roleplay and avatars** in MUDs/MOOs
- **Graphical worlds** like Habitat

Online, users were:
- Liberated from physical constraints
- Free to experiment with gender, persona, voice
- Anchored only by their reputation and creativity

**Net Identity Concepts:**
- *“On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog”*
- Avatars as alter-egos
- Online selves as memetic presence

These practices became the **foundation of digital personhood**, now central to all online interaction.
