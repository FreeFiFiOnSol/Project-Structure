# The Origin and Evolution of the Term “Meme”

## Overview
This document explores the origin of the term “meme” in its Darwinian context, as introduced by Richard Dawkins, and charts its evolution into a cornerstone of digital culture. Grounded in evolutionary psychology and memetics, the concept of memes as cultural replicators has transformed significantly in online networks, influencing communication, commerce, and politics. In the FreeFiFiOnSol universe, this evolution resonates with FiFi’s meme coin roots on Solana, where cultural ideas—encoded as viral, mutable content—interweave with blockchain technology.

## I. Proto-Memetic Epoch (Pre-Internet Influencers)
The term “meme” was coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book *The Selfish Gene*, a foundational text in evolutionary psychology and memetics. Dawkins derived the word from the Greek *mimeme* (meaning “imitated thing”), shortening it to rhyme with “gene” for conceptual symmetry. He defined memes as units of cultural transmission—ideas, behaviors, or symbols such as tunes, catchphrases, architectural styles, or religious beliefs—that replicate through imitation, much like genes propagate through biological reproduction. In this Darwinian framework, memes evolve via variation, mutation, and selection, acting as “selfish replicators” that prioritize their own survival, influencing human behavior and culture from their residence in the brain.

Dawkins’s concept, part of the emerging field of memetics, posited that cultural evolution mirrors biological evolution, with memes competing for survival in a “meme pool.” However, the theory faced scrutiny: unlike genes, which replicate with high fidelity via DNA, memes lack a tangible replicator, and their rapid mutation rate—ideas change with each retelling—challenges the strict Darwinian analogy. Scholars like Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson critiqued memetics, favoring gene-culture coevolution models that emphasize biological advantage over meme autonomy. Despite these challenges, Dawkins’s idea, while not internet-native, planted a philosophical seed that later flourished online, offering a lens to understand cultural transmission.

## II. Digital Mutation: Memes in Online Networks
The concept of memes transformed profoundly as it entered digital networks, diverging from Dawkins’s original Darwinian framework. The term “Internet meme” was coined by Mike Godwin in a 1993 *Wired* article, describing how ideas spread through early online platforms like Usenet and email. The “Dancing Baby,” a 1996 3D animation shared via email chains, marked one of the first viral Internet memes, illustrating the potential for rapid digital dissemination.

The late 2000s and early 2010s saw an explosion of memes with the rise of social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter (now X), Instagram, and later TikTok. Memes became predominantly visual, often humorous images, videos, or GIFs with overlaid text, such as “Doge” (2010), featuring a Shiba Inu with broken English captions, or “Grumpy Cat” (2012), which became a global phenomenon. These memes evolved through remixing and intertextuality—blending cultural references across contexts. For example, the “Star Wars Kid” video (2002) inspired countless renditions, while “All your base are belong to us” (from a 1990s video game) became a widely remixed phrase, showcasing how Internet memes maintain core messages through adaptation.

The *Cyborgism Wiki* (https://cyborgism.wiki/) highlights that digital memes are “hyper-mutable,” evolving through collective user interaction rather than natural selection, a process more Lamarckian (acquired traits passed on) than Darwinian. A study by Michele Knobel and Colin Lankshear, referenced in Wikipedia, examines how Dawkins’s characteristics of successful memes—fidelity, fecundity, and longevity—apply to Internet memes:
- **Replicability**: Memes are frequently modified through remixing, maintaining core messages (e.g., “All your base are belong to us”).
- **Fecundity**: Humor, intertextuality (e.g., “Star Wars Kid”), and juxtaposition (e.g., “Bert is Evil”) promote rapid spread.
- **Longevity**: Memes like “Doge” persist, evolving over time, even influencing economic trends like Dogecoin cryptocurrency.

### Comparison of Traditional and Internet Memes
| Aspect            | Traditional Memes          | Internet Memes                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Medium**        | Verbal, visual, books      | Images, videos, GIFs, social media |
| **Spread Mechanism** | Conversation, print media | Sharing, remixing, viral platforms |
| **Examples**      | Catchphrases, tunes        | Grumpy Cat, Doge, Overly-Attached Girlfriend |
| **Evolution**     | Slow, generational         | Rapid, real-time                  |

This table underscores the shift from slow, generational spread to rapid, digital dissemination, driven by social media algorithms that amplify virality. Memes like “Pepe the Frog,” originally a 2005 comic character by Matt Furie, evolved into a controversial political symbol by 2016, reflecting how digital memes can accrue unintended meanings.

Internet memes have become a linchpin of digital communication, influencing language, politics, and commerce. However, Dawkins has expressed mixed feelings, noting in a 2013 *Wired* interview that the internet’s use of “meme” is a “hijacking” of his original concept, focusing on a narrow subset of viral content rather than broader cultural practices like accents or traditions. Academically, memetics faced criticism in the 1990s for empirical challenges, with some questioning the categorization of culture into discrete units, though neuroimaging offers potential for future study.

In the FreeFiFiOnSol universe, this digital evolution mirrors FiFi’s meme coin roots on Solana. Internet memes, with their viral, mutable nature, reflect the decentralized, community-driven ethos of Web3, where cultural ideas—encoded as NFTs or tokens—interweave with blockchain technology, blending mythic lore with digital innovation.
